# ⚙️ SOL 1D Breakthrough – TP1 + Slow EMA Trail

**April 22, 2025**  
_By cavpatrol_

## 🧠 A Clean Win on the Daily

After dozens of failed backtests, I’ve finally locked in a daily config for SOLUSDT that beats HODL with structural clarity.

This wasn't achieved by adding more filters or complexity — it came from simplifying the exit logic, reducing TP greed, and using a more natural trailing stop.

---

## 🔁 What Changed

The final config uses:

- `strategy_mode: trailing_after_tp1`
- `tp_multipliers: [1.5, 3.5]`
- `trailing_mode: slow_ema`
- No RSI or MACD filters
- Trend alignment enabled

This combo lets the system:

- 🟢 Take early profit at 1.5× ATR
- 📉 Exit with structure via the slow EMA
- 📊 Maximize reward with just 8 trades
- 🛡 Protect downside without overfiltering

It’s not fragile. It’s not overfitted. It just works.

## 📈 Backtest Results (SOLUSDT 1D)

- 💰 **PnL:** +765.65
- 🚀 **Alpha vs HODL:** +1394.90
- 📈 **Sharpe:** 0.44
- 🎯 **Win Rate:** 37.5%
- 📉 **Max Drawdown:** 226.21
- 🔁 **Trades:** 8

## 🔧 Strategy Refinement Notes

Originally, this strategy was trailing on ATR. Results were consistent but flat.

Switching to a **close below `ema_slow`** as the trailing exit immediately improved win rate, drawdown, and alpha — especially when combined with a lower TP1.

This aligns well with how SOL trends: quick bursts that fade into consolidation. The EMA acts as a natural structure boundary, not just a math ratio.

---

## 🛠 Python + Pine Aligned

The PineScript generator now supports:

- `trailing_mode: slow_ema`
- Entry + TP1 + trailing exit alerts
- Labels and alert text compatible with my `email_parser.py` → Telegram flow

And everything is locked to the exact config that produced these results.

```bash
python run.py --mode export-pine
```

---

## 🔮 What’s Next

- Port this config to 4H + 1H on SOL, ETH, and BTC
- Evaluate slow EMA trailing on trend-follow variants
- Add partial-trailing hybrids (TP1 then ATR)
- Publish this as a baseline “ritual config” in the dashboard

---

## 🧘 Why It Works

We didn’t “optimize” for profit.  
We refined structure.  
The result is a repeatable swing framework that rewards discipline.

> Exit slow.  
> Think clean.  
> One position, at a time.
