# ⚙️ VOLT 1.2 – CLI Refinements, Alerts, and Structure Sync

**April 19, 2025 (Later)**

## 🛠 What Changed in 1.2

After launching the core VOLT system, I spent the next cycle refining its structure for modularity, CLI clarity, and compatibility with my evolving alert flow.

VOLT 1.2 is less about adding *new features* — and more about locking in clean **execution flows**, **reusable output**, and a bridge between **Python logic and TradingView alerts**.

Key upgrades:

- 📁 **Unified run modes** via `run.py` — backtest, sweep, postprocess, and export all from one CLI  
- 🔄 **Postprocessing overhaul** — now includes diagnostics, tagging, and auto-export to `.pine` and `.json`  
- 📬 **Email-to-Telegram alert parser** — live TradingView alerts parsed and piped into Telegram  
- 🧠 **Consistent strategy stack** — EMA crossover now has aligned logic across Python + PineScript  
- 🔧 **Config + param overrides** — all sweep/backtest logic dynamically driven from CLI args

## 📡 Live Alerts (v0.1) – TradingView to Telegram

Right now, my alerts are powered by TradingView.  
Each strategy export includes alert lines like:

```
VOLT: LONG BTCUSDT @ 62785.2 | SL: 61230.0 | TP: 64823.5  
VOLT: EXIT (TP2 Hit) @ 64823.5
```

These get emailed to a special inbox, where a **headless Python parser** extracts the message body and sends it to **Telegram via bot API**.

✅ It’s simple.  
✅ It’s working.  
⚠️ It’s temporary.

The end goal is a **real-time Python monitor loop** that watches live data and fires alerts directly. But for now, this hybrid approach keeps the signal system transparent and easy to debug.

## 🧪 Sweep + Postprocess Pipeline

The postprocess pipeline got a full rewrite in 1.2:

- Auto-ranks by Sharpe, Alpha, PnL, Win Rate  
- Adds tags like "Beats HODL" or "Drawdown > 80%"  
- Outputs:
  - `backtest_summary.json`  
  - `latest_metrics.json`  
  - `latest_trades.json`  
  - Top result `.pine` and `.json`

It also auto-generates leaderboards and publishes PineScript tied to the **exact tested config**.

```bash
python run.py --mode postprocess --symbol BTCUSDT --timeframe 15m --strategy ema_crossover --top_n 10
```

Everything is reproducible from the CLI.

## 🧬 VOLT CLI Overview (v1.2)

```bash
python run.py --mode backtest     # Run single backtest  
python run.py --mode sweep        # Sweep across param grid  
python run.py --mode postprocess  # Rank + tag + export  
python run.py --mode export-pine  # Generate PineScript only
```

Overrides like this are now supported:

```bash
--sl_mult 2.0  
--tp_multipliers "[2.0, 3.0]"  
--use_rsi_filter  
--trailing_stop_ratio 0.15
```

This makes it trivial to rerun a strategy with different assumptions — or reproduce results from a sweep.

## 🔍 What I’ll Focus on Next

- 🔄 Replacing TradingView alerts with Python-based monitor  
- 📊 Expanding sweep coverage to 1H / 4H and other pairs  
- 🧾 Publishing a **live JSON strategy health feed** (alpha, drawdown, trades)  
- 🖼 Surfacing key charts on the public dashboard

## ✨ Still the Same Philosophy

VOLT is not a profit-maximizing black box.  
It’s a clarity machine — structured, transparent, and built for real-world use.

> Think in systems.  
> Trade with intention.  
> One position, one ritual, at a time.

More soon.
