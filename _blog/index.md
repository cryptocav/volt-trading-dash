# ðŸ§  Build Log

This section documents the ongoing development of the VOLT engine â€” a modular crypto trading system focused on clarity, allocation, and beating buy-and-hold with fewer, smarter trades.

VOLT started as a single-symbol backtest script. It has evolved into a **full research engine and allocation model** â€” now operating under the PRISM framework.

The log will track major architecture improvements, system philosophy, and practical lessons as PRISM continues to mature.
