# 🧠 Build Log

This section documents the ongoing development of the VOLT engine — a modular crypto trading system focused on clarity, allocation, and beating buy-and-hold with fewer, smarter trades.

VOLT started as a single-symbol backtest script. It has evolved into a **full research engine and allocation model** — now operating under the PRISM framework.

The log will track major architecture improvements, system philosophy, and practical lessons as PRISM continues to mature.

More build notes coming soon as PRISM’s live features, sweep engine, and strategy framework continue to evolve.

Stay sharp.
