# âš¡ The VOLT Journey So Far â€” From Backtests to Allocation Engine

**June 2025**  
_By cavpatrol_

VOLT began as a personal experiment:  
**Could I build a trading system that beats BTC by trading smarter â€” not more?**

Hereâ€™s how the system has evolved:

---

## ðŸŒ€ Phase 1 â€” Signal Generator

My earliest prototypes were simple: single-symbol backtests (BTCUSDT), basic EMA crossovers, mean reversion logic, static PineScript exports.

They taught me an important truth:

> **Beating BTC by trading BTC alone is very hard.**

No matter how good the filters, BTC buy-and-hold was extremely tough to outperform.

---

## ðŸŒ€ Phase 2 â€” Modular Backtest Framework

The next version introduced:

- Separate strategy modules (EMA, breakout, mean reversion)
- YAML-driven configs
- Sweep engine with grid search
- Postprocessing and Pine export
- CLI runner

VOLT started to feel like a **real research tool** â€” but still operated on a one-symbol, one-strategy basis.

---

## ðŸŒ€ Phase 3 â€” Allocation Engine (PRISM)

The key insight:

> You donâ€™t beat BTC by forcing trades. You beat BTC by **allocating capital into strength**, and sitting out when thereâ€™s none.

This led to PRISM:

- Sector-aware multi-coin universe  
- Daily momentum, trend, volatility filters  
- Weighted allocation logic (BTC anchor + dynamic alts)  
- Mass scan + compare backtests vs BTC/ETH/flat  
- Skipped coins validation  
- Live Telegram alerts (in active testing)  
- Full research pipeline

PRISM is now a **modular allocation engine** â€” built to rotate into outperformers and preserve capital when no edge exists.

---

## ðŸš€ Current Focus

- Dynamic allocation sizing  
- Live mode (intraday scanning)  
- Improved PineScript exports  
- Enhanced sweep / compare framework  
- More robust sector metadata pipeline  

---

## ðŸ§­ Philosophy

VOLT is not a black box.  
It is a **clarity machine** â€” built to:

- Think in systems  
- Filter with intention  
- Trade only when edge exists  
- Stay transparent and reproducible

**Thank you to everyone following the journey.**  
The system is still evolving â€” and this Build Log will continue to document the path.

Stay tuned. Stay sharp.
