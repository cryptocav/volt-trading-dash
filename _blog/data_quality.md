# 🛠️ The Invisible Work — Why Good Data Matters in Trading Systems

**June 2025**  
_By cavpatrol_

---

Every trading engine is only as good as the data it consumes.

Lately I’ve been focused on a part of the pipeline that most people ignore:

> **Getting the upstream data clean, curated, and relevant.**

---

## 🗂️ Top-of-Funnel Quality First

Most public APIs flood you with noise:

- Irrelevant coins
- Inconsistent labels
- Outdated categories
- Wrapped assets, stablecoins, dead projects, and meme spam

Left unchecked, this noise **pollutes your backtests and signals** — leading to false confidence in "alpha" that won’t survive in production.

---

## 🖋️ Manual Review Pass

Rather than blindly trust API tags, I’ve been:

- Cross-checking coin metadata  
- Applying domain knowledge  
- Manually vetting which coins belong in which categories  
- Maintaining an explicit category override map  

---

## 🏗️ Why Modular Design Pays Off

Because PRISM is fully modular:

- I can improve metadata without breaking downstream scans or backtests  
- Category logic is centralized and transparent  
- New buckets or corrections flow cleanly through the system  

This has already surfaced **many subtle issues** that would otherwise skew allocation decisions.

---

## 🎯 Principle

I believe strongly in:

> **Filter upstream. Stay reproducible. Only trade what you understand.**

Clean data is invisible work — but it protects everything downstream.

---

**More updates soon.**  
As always — build with care. Trade with clarity.
