# ðŸ“Š Strategy Results

Welcome to the strategy lab for the VOLT engine.

VOLTâ€™s current focus is **PRISM** â€” a precision allocation model designed to intelligently rotate USDC into the strongest-performing crypto assets.  
The system is in **active development** and is already showing promising results in certain sectors (for example, recent sweeps show that following PRISM signals on memecoins over the past ~500 days would have outperformed buy-and-hold BTC).

## ðŸ§  Current Status

PRISM is not a fixed "strategy" â€” it is an evolving **research engine**.  
We are continuously refining:

- Sector filters and metadata enrichment
- Momentum, trend, volatility, and allocation logic
- Sweep-testing methodology
- Live alert and benchmarking processes

At this stage, we are not publishing detailed per-coin reports â€” results will vary as the system evolves.  
**Images and summaries from recent PRISM runs will be added here soon.**

## ðŸ“¬ Request a Custom Backtest

If you would like to explore PRISM performance on a particular:

- Sector (e.g. DeFi, Gaming, Memecoins, Layer 1s)  
- Pair list or timeframe  
- Allocation mode or parameter set  

â†’ please reach out via [ðŸ“¬ Contact]({{ "/contact/" | relative_url }}).  
Iâ€™m happy to run **custom backtests** and share the findings.

VOLT is an open system â€” the goal is to think clearly about markets and share useful insights as the research progresses.

Stay tuned â€” and stay sharp.
