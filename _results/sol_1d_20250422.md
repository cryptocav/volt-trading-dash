# 🧪 SOLUSDT 1D – EMA Crossover (TP1 + Slow EMA Trail)

This config represents the best-performing 1D swing strategy on SOL to date — leveraging early partial profit-taking followed by a clean trailing exit based on the slow EMA. It consistently outperforms HODL and produced its highest alpha yet during a drawdown-heavy year.
