# 🙌 Support

VOLT is a solo-built crypto trading system focused on clarity, modularity, and beating HODL with fewer, smarter trades.

Every part of the stack — from backtesting to PineScript generation to Telegram alerts — is built from scratch and made transparent for others to learn from or fork.

## 💡 Why Support Matters

Your support helps me:

- ⚡ Accelerate feature development (e.g. Pine trailing logic, real-time dashboards, L2 strategy support)
- 🧪 Test more strategies, symbols, and timeframes
- 🧰 Build public tools faster and more cleanly
- 📡 Maintain live signal infra and documentation

Even small tips help me allocate more time and energy to VOLT — without relying on sponsorships or locking anything behind paywalls.
