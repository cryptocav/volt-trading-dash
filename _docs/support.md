# 🙌 Support

VOLT is a solo-built crypto trading system focused on clarity, modularity, and beating HODL with fewer, smarter trades.

Every part of the stack — from backtesting to PineScript generation to Telegram alerts — is built from scratch and made transparent for others to learn from or fork.

**PRISM**, the live allocation model behind VOLT, is in active testing — with results and signals evolving rapidly as the system matures.

## 💡 Why Support Matters

Your support helps me:

- ⚡ Accelerate feature development (dynamic allocation sizing, intraday live mode, advanced Pine exports)
- 🧪 Test more strategies, sectors, and timeframes at scale
- 🧰 Build public tools faster and more cleanly
- 📡 Maintain live signal infrastructure and documentation

Even small tips help me allocate more time and energy to VOLT — without relying on sponsorships or locking anything behind paywalls.
