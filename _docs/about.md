# ⚡ About VOLT

VOLT is a modular crypto trading engine built by **@cavpatrol** — a longtime believer in decentralization, sovereignty, and the slow art of stacking sats.

I've been in crypto for over five years, working at **Magic Eden** and now **Slingshot**, helping shape real product experiences around real market behavior.

Beneath the charts and code is a deeper philosophy:  
**Clarity over complexity. Fewer trades, better trades. Filtered, not forced.**

VOLT isn't just a script or strategy. It’s a **system for engaging with markets** — where every signal is earned, not guessed — and where every allocation is driven by real momentum and sector strength.

## 🧰 What VOLT Is

VOLT is a command-line powered system built for modularity, transparency, and intelligent allocation. It includes:

- 🧪 [Backtest Engine]({{ "/results/" | relative_url }})  
  Simulates multi-asset allocation with slippage, commissions, and risk management.

- 🔁 Sweep System  
  Explores parameter grids and ranks configs by your targets (Sharpe, max drawdown, alpha vs BTC).

- 🧠 [Postprocessing + Dev Log]({{ "/blog/" | relative_url }})  
  Documents mass scan results, strategy refinements, and system improvements.

- 📈 [PineScript Generator]({{ "/pine/" | relative_url }})  
  Generates clean, alert-ready TradingView scripts from tested configs.

- 📡 Allocation Engine + Signal Monitor  
  Scans the crypto universe daily and dispatches top allocation signals to Telegram.

All results are published with downloadable outputs. The system is transparent, reproducible, and improving with each iteration.

## 🧭 Why I Built It

Most retail trading strategies are overcomplicated and underperform.  
VOLT is my answer — a toolset for:

- Thinking clearly about edge  
- Avoiding overfitting traps  
- Capturing **relative strength** — rotating capital into outperformers, not forcing trades  
- Beating passive HODL with smarter, data-driven allocations

After years of backtesting single-asset strategies, I learned firsthand:  
**beating BTC by trading BTC is hard.**  
Beating BTC by allocating across **the right assets at the right time** — that is where real opportunity lies.  
VOLT’s architecture is built around this principle.

## 🛣️ What’s Next

The system is under **active development** — you’ll see this reflected in evolving results and test alerts.

Near-term roadmap:

- 🛠️ Dynamic allocation sizing based on momentum strength and volatility  
- 🚧 Live mode (intraday scans and faster alerts)  
- 📊 Telegram loop surfacing daily allocation changes + sector performance  
- 🔍 Validation layer to ensure clean data and transparent skipped coins  
- ⚙️ Modular strategy framework for future expansion (long/short, sector tilt, leverage models)
