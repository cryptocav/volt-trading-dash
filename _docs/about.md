# ⚡ About VOLT

VOLT is a modular crypto trading engine built by **@cavpatrol** — a longtime believer in decentralization, sovereignty, and the slow art of stacking sats.

I've been in crypto for over five years. I’ve worked at **Magic Eden** and now **Slingshot**, helping shape real product experiences around real market behavior.

But beneath the charts and code is a deeper philosophy:  
**Clarity over complexity. Fewer trades, better trades. Filtered, not forced.**

VOLT isn't just a script or strategy. It's a **system for engaging with markets** — where every signal is earned, not guessed.

## 🧰 What VOLT Is

VOLT is a command-line powered system built for modularity and visibility. It includes:

- 🧪 [Backtest Engine]({{ "/results/" | relative_url }})  
  Simulates trade execution with slippage, commissions, and risk management.

- 🔁 [Sweep System]({{ "/results/btc_15m_20250419" | relative_url }})  
  Explores multiple configs and ranks them based on your goals (Sharpe, win rate, alpha vs HODL).

- 🧠 [Postprocessing + Dev Log]({{ "/blog/" | relative_url }})  
  Documents sweep outcomes, strategy tweaks, bugfixes, and live tests.

- 📈 [PineScript Generator]({{ "/pine/" | relative_url }})  
  Produces clean, alert-ready TradingView scripts from tested configs.

- 📡 Signal Monitor (Python)  
  Monitors live markets and dispatches alerts to Telegram in real-time.

All strategy results are published with downloadable `.json` and `.pine` files. The entire system is transparent, reproducible, and improving with each iteration.

## 🧭 Why I Built It

Most retail trading strategies are overcomplicated and underperform.  
VOLT is my answer to that — a toolset for:

- Thinking clearly about edge
- Avoiding overfitting traps
- Capturing directional momentum with clean filters and minimal noise

The goal isn’t to flip bags.  
The goal is to **beat passive HODL** with smarter entries, cleaner exits, and real stats to prove it.

- 🚧 Breakout strategies are in prototyping  
- 📊 Telegram loop will surface strategy health + live signals
