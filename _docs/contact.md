# 📬 Contact

Whether you’re curious about VOLT strategies, want to collaborate, or just want to talk shop — I’m always open to hearing from serious builders, traders, or researchers.

You can reach me here:

- 🧑‍💻 **GitHub:** [cryptocav](https://github.com/cryptocav)  
- 🐦 **X (Twitter):** [@cavpatrol](https://x.com/cavpatrol)  
- 📧 **Email:** [volt-signals@proton.me](mailto:volt-signals@proton.me)  
- 📡 **Telegram:** [`@volt_signals`](https://t.me/volt_signals)

If you’re testing or following the VOLT system, feel free to share your configs, sweep results, or any PineScript improvements — or just reach out to compare notes.

**Feedback is always welcome — especially as PRISM continues to evolve in its live testing phase.**
