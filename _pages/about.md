Hi, I’m Cav — systems builder, strategy optimizer, and creator of the VOLT engine.

**VOLT** is a modular crypto trading system built from scratch in Python and PineScript. It powers all the signals, backtests, and strategy configurations shown on this site.

This site exists as:
- A public lab notebook
- A weekly reference for signals
- A portfolio of trading engineering work
