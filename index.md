# ⚡ VOLT Strategy Dashboard

Welcome to the public‑facing lab for the **VOLT crypto trading engine** —  
a modular system for testing, evolving, and deploying automated crypto strategies with full transparency.

Currently, the site is focused on **PRISM**, VOLT’s live allocation model. PRISM scans the crypto universe daily and dynamically allocates USDC into top-performing assets using a blend of momentum, trend, volatility, and sector filters.

The system is in **active refinement**. You may see test alerts and intermittent signals firing to [@volt_signals](https://t.me/volt_signals) — stay tuned as the model matures and more features go live.

**Why multi-coin?**  
During extensive single-asset testing, VOLT’s creator learned that consistently outperforming BTC by trading BTC itself is extremely difficult. The edge comes from identifying periods where specific sectors or altcoins are gaining relative strength and dynamically allocating capital accordingly. PRISM embodies this principle.

VOLT is built to be lightweight, modular, and transparent.  
It’s not a black box — it’s a public experiment in how to think clearly about crypto markets.

Stay sharp.
