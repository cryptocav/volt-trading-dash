# ⚡ VOLT Strategy Dashboard

Welcome to the public‑facing lab for the **VOLT crypto trading engine** —  
a modular system for testing, evolving, and deploying automated strategies with full transparency.

Currently, this site is focused on **PRISM**, the active signal model behind VOLT’s daily allocation engine. PRISM intelligently allocates USDC into top-performing crypto assets using daily momentum, trend, and volatility filters — with results posted daily on [@volt_signals](https://t.me/volt_signals).

Whether you're looking to follow live signals, run your own strategy experiments, or learn how to build robust systems — you're in the right place.
